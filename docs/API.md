API

```
Granular access control provides security down to the API level.
Make data-driven decisions through API usage, analytics and insights.
API publishing, lifecycle management, application development, access control, rate limiting and analytics
API Gateway and Microgateway - eliminates the need for a central gateway by enabling enterprises to apply API management policies in a decentralized fashion.
API Security - Authenticate and authorize API requests from any client or device type making requests to resource servers operating on traditional and microservice architectures.
Key Manager - The Key Manager is the STS (Security Token Service) that issues tokens that can be used by resource servers for authentication and authorization of requests. It supports a wide range of OAuth grant types and is capable of issuing both opaque and signed self contained tokens.
API Store (Developer Portal) - Enables developers to discover APIs, test them before consumption
Collaborative API and Application Lifecycle Management - Enables the design, implementation and documentation of APIs with business planning. Facilitates the management of the API Lifecycle across environments, data centers, and regions.
Business Insights and Anomaly Detection - Monitors system behavior, as well as API and application usage at operations and business levels.

Publisher - A structured GUI designed for API creators to develop, document, scale and version APIs, while also facilitating more API management-related tasks such as publishing APIs
Traffic Manager - Helps users to regulate API traffic, make APIs and applications available to consumers at different service levels, and secure APIs against security attacks. The Traffic Manager features a dynamic throttling engine to process throttling policies in real-time, including rate limiting of API requests
Analytics - API Manager integrates with the WSO2 Analytics platform to provide reports, statistics and graphs on the APIs deployed in WSO2 API Manager. Enable Alerts to monitor APIs and react on anomalies. Gain insights by geography, user categories and more.
Configure alerts to monitor these APIs and detect unusual activity, manage locations via geo location statistics and carry out detailed analysis of the logs.

OpenAPI aka. Swagger is a widely used API description format. The idea is to:

render an API directly with swagger-ui within file view
provide a link to open an api spec directly within a swagger-editor
further options could be to store changed API from editor back to GitLab

The integration could be similar to plantuml.
